        [2, 182 - ensemble classifier - may work better?] -> 100 shows not.
        
        messing with inputs
        [271 - feature squeezing, 63-jpg compression]
        [34 - defence overview]
        [103 - tried to use strength of softmax]
        People have also tried adjusting activation functions etc (e.g. 277)

<p><small>    Tabacof, 2016 also investigate noise added to images. Oddly find that `for the same task, a shallow classifier seems <b>more robust</b> to adversarial images than a deep convolutional network'.</small></p> -- might be scale of change you can get is greater when weights are multiplied together?
